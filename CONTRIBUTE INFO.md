Here's a section of information for contributing to the extension. This is probably just going to be notes to myself.

## TODO
- [ ] Figure out the function.operator inside function.math issue
- [ ] Set an Expressions theme to highlite alphanumerics (assumed to be user defined expressions)  
- [ ] Add numeric section (check to see if there are math operators, then highlite numbers)
- [ ] Look up "citern" and add similar constants to a new selection. Probably keep with constants
